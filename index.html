                While he can hold anger for what characters like Asriel had done in the past, he is willing to forgive and start anew. Sans also is willing to put his life down if it means his loved ones can have a future, even if he wants one. It is evident through him taking a fatal hit to save Asriel’s life. As shown in Animosity, he also deeply cares for his family, despite knowing that Gaster injected Determination into him, Sans didn't act as differently and forgave Gaster. When Bete turns Sans' controlled Gaster Blasters onto Papyrus and Gaster, Sans counters with an even bigger wall of Gaster Blasters and saves them, however, at the cost of his life, showing how much deeply he cared for them Species

                Sans is shown to have a smile on his face almost at all times, showing how relaxed he is even in dreadful or serious situations while knowing he and his friends have the cards in their favor, or will at some point. However, once things step out of line and death and destruction are involved, Sans will immediately drop the facade and become serious, even frowning as a result.While he can hold anger for what characters like Asriel had done in the past, he is willing to forgive and start a new.

            Despite being an easy going skeleton who is considered "chill", Sans does have an angry and serious side to him. In the Underground, Sans had acted especially lazy because he knew that any progress he’d made would be reset. Though, in Glitchtale, when Frisk breaks the reset button, he begins to realize he finally has a future and is not as lazy as he was in the past, though he still acts laid back most likely because it's grown on him. However, when Frisk was wanting to Reset after they promised not to, Sans became immediately infuriated at Frisk for lying and being selfish (as it seemed odd that when a problem occurred, the first thing they thought of was to Reset without thinking of the consequences for their friends) and would have killed them in retaliation if not for Asriel.
